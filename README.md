# 3D-Mold-Visualizer-Roblox
A data-driven 3D interactive prototype designed to simulate and visualize mold growth in an educational environment. By utilizing real-world data collected from an actual art classroom, this project maps environmental metrics to dynamic visual effects (VFX) and user interface (UI) elements. Users can interact with a custom-coded slider to observe the proportional severity and spread of the mold in real-time.

# Core Features
Interactive Severity Slider: A fully scripted UI slider that serves as the core interactive element, allowing users to seamlessly control and scrub through the severity levels of the mold outbreak.

Real-World Data Integration: The visualization is grounded in reality. The simulation uses authentic data taken directly from a physical art classroom, providing an accurate representation of how the mold actually developed and spread.

Proportional Scaling System: As the slider is adjusted, the underlying code dynamically calculates and scales the 3D mold assets to match the exact severity metrics from the real-world dataset.

Visual Effects & UI Design
Custom Mold VFX: Leveraged advanced visual effect systems to create realistic representations of mold spores, growth clusters, and environmental decay on the classroom surfaces.

Responsive UI Scripting: Developed a clean user interface that effectively bridges the raw data with the visual front-end. The slider triggers instant, smooth visual updates without jittering or breaking immersion.

Atmospheric Impact: The 3D space of the art classroom actively shifts in visual tone as the severity increases, creating an informative and highly visual data-mapping experience.

# Technical Details
Developer Note: The primary technical challenge of this project was translating raw, static environmental data into compelling, accurately scaled 3D visuals. It required a strong balance of UI programming and dynamic VFX manipulation to ensure the mold spread felt organic while remaining strictly tied to the data's proportions.


Performance Optimization: The scaling math is optimized to ensure that rendering high-density mold visuals at the maximum severity level on the slider maintains a stable framerate.
